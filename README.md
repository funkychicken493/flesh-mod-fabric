Flesh is flesh. Where there's smoke, there's fire.

Have an unnecessary obssesion with flesh? Want to freak out your friends with a meat castle? Well now you can!

Mod is built specifically for Fabric 1.18.2, do not ask for a forge version please. This is my first mod, there are most certainly bugs. Please report them to issues.

**Mod is not considered stable for modpack use.**
